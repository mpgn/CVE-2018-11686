### Proof Of Concept:

1. **Removing the config files**

The file `change_config.php` of FlexPaper (PHP) doesn't check if the adminsitrator is authentication properly, allowing an attacker to delete arbitrary files on the server:

- The yellow line shows where the configuration should be placed
- The red lines show the path taken by an attacker to delete files on the server using the `unlink` PHP function

An attacker can craft a request like this and delete files on the folder of his choice:
```
POST /flexpaper/php/change_config.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8888
[...]

SAVE_CONFIG=1&SWF_Directory=config/
```
With this request, an attacker deletes all files on the `config` directory.

2. **Setup a new config file**

Since all files on the `config/` folder are deleted, FlexPaper will think that the application has never been initialized:

Therefore an attacker is able to setup again the FlexPaper. But why ?

3. **Execute arbitrary command**

Inside the `setup.php` there is a function called `pdf2swfEnabled` that uses the command `exec` in PHP with a parameter passed in POST by the user. Since this is the initialisation (check 2.) of FlexPaper there is no authentication.

An attacker can craft a payload like this: `?step=4&PDF2SWF_PATH=id;` resulting `exec(id; --version 2>&1)`.

4. **Getting the output**

The attacker can redirect the output of the command inside the a file inside the `config` folder and make a GET request to read the output:
